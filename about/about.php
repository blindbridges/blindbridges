<h1>About us</h1>
<h2>What is Blind Bridges?</h2>
<p>The Blind Bridges Informational Exchange Group (Blind Bridges for short) is a website devoted to bridging the gap between the blind community and the mainstream. Part of this goal is providing information, so we strive to cover as many topics as we can through our podcast and other means. These topics could be anything, from teaching a blind person how to cook, to showing sighted people how to effectively teach a blind student in school or college. We are not experts, but our goal to help disabled and able-bodied people alike remains the same, no matter what.</p>

<h3>Garrett</h3>
<p>My name is Garrett Brown. I was born with sight, but a dog attack at the age of 22 months left me both without vision and the index finger on my left hand. Nevertheless, that doesn't stop me from doing the things I want to do in life. I'm a gamer and an amateur musician, and I'm attempting to learn Japanese. One of my goals in life is to learn a few more languages and become a translator, because people who can translate articles and such are in high demand. As someone who is interested in languages, I am equally fascinated with culture as well.</p>
<p>As for my direct role, I maintain the entire website, though I am not the main owner. I am also the editor of the Blind Bridges Podcast. Therefore, if you wish to contact me to suggest changes to the website or for further questions, <a href="mailto://garrett@blindbridges.org">you can contact me here.</a></p>

<h3>Firecat</h3>
<p>My name is Richard Brooks, though I  go by the nicknames Firecat and or R.J. I  have been totally blind since birth, mainly due to doctors in competencies. The total blindness I  consider a  very useful advantage for the most part; because it allows me to think and do things in an entirely different way from most, due to the fact that I  have never had any visual reference points of any kind.</p>
<p>Even though the web site was my creation and I  own it; I give Garrett credit for doing all of the work: because he knows more about these things than I am ever likely to know or want to know. Him and I make a hell of a team.  We welcome anyone else who wants to help in the project to get on board. Thanks to all in advance, and <a href="mailto://firecat@blindbridges.org">here's my email</a> if you have any questions.</p>
