<p>A few major changes have been made.</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing short episodes! These episodes are exactly 5 minutes long and are perfect for listening when you don't have time to listen to a full episode. <a href="podcast/short1">You can listen to our first short here</a>
<li>Added headings to the podcast page to distinguish full episodes from short episodes
<li>We now have a schedule for uploading podcasts. We will upload regular podcasts every other Monday, but we'll also upload short episodes from time to time on Saturday as a bonus.
<li>This website is now open sourced! For those who aren't sure what that means, <a href="https://github.com/blindbridges/blindbridges">the viewers of this website can now directly contribute by adding features and pages,</a> as well as fixing issues. Don't worry; every contribution has to be reviewed before it makes it onto the website itself, so nothing can be tampered with or destroyed.
